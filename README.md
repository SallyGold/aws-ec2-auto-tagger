# aws-ec2-auto-tagger
Automatically Tagging EC2 Instances upon creation and sending a Slack Alert using  Cloudtrail logs.

When an EC2 is created AWS Cloudwatch events rule will be triggered and and that rule will invoke a lambda function.
Within that lambda function the cloudtrail event data generated by the EC2 creation event is parsed and add the IAM user data + other relevant data as Tags.
